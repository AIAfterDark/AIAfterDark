## Mission

Democratizing AI advancement through practical implementation. My repositories serve as a bridge between theoretical research and real-world applications, documented through the lens of someone who pursues AI research outside traditional academic or industry roles.

## Focus Areas

- Experimental AI implementations with practical applications
- Documentation focused on accessibility and understanding
- Tools that make AI more approachable for weekend warriors
- Research reproductions with detailed explanations

## Projects

Each repository represents a journey from concept to implementation, documented through the perspective of someone who builds these projects in the hours after dark. You'll find:

- Step-by-step implementation guides
- Practical applications of theoretical concepts
- Weekend-friendly project structures
- Detailed documentation for reproducibility

## Collaboration

Open to connecting with other after-hours researchers and enthusiasts. Particularly interested in:

- Novel AI applications
- Experimental implementations
- Knowledge sharing
- Community-driven development
